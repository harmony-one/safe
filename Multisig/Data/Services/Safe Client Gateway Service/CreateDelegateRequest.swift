/// This is used for push notification registration and can be used for other functions, such as proposing transactions.
/// Delegator signs a message containing delegate address. Then, the delegate would be allowed to register
/// for push notifications and provide its signature. This way the app doesn't need repeated access to the
/// delegator's key and can use the delegate key instead. This won't affect signing transactions, but it is
/// useful for other convenience features, such as push notifications.
