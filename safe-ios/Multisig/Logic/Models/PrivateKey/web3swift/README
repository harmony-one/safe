Files in the web3swift folder are taken from https://github.com/matter-labs/web3swift project (Apache License 2.0). Some of them are slightly modified.

The decision was not to include this project as a pod because:
1. The pod required usage of frameworks
2. There are dependencies that we do not need (PromiseKit, Starscream)
3. We needed it only for the mnemonic to private key logic, but for the other Ethereum-related operations we already use Web3 dependency
